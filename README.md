<h1>Eiser ecommerce</h1>

## User Panel
Users can register for account and login to use the website.
Like normal ecommerce sytem, users will be able to browse the products, search for specific item and they can look detail for each of the item. Add to cart function is also available to add the products to cart. After their shopping is finished can finally checkout to the order process. In the mean time, they can also remove items from the cart if they changed their mind or accidentailly put the the items to cart.

## Admin Panel
Admin panel mainly supposed to be able to manage the products, categories and reports. For this reasons , I added management screen for products. Admin will be able to add, update, delete the products from the admin panel. Same functionalites for the categories as well. Admin can also see the order and order detail listings which are like the reports from customer's shopping. Moreover, I added some reporting stuffs like weekly and monthly report.
